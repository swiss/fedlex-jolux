# Impacts

Impacts is what connect entries in the CC and OC. The entries in the CC are consolidations of entries in the **Official Compilation** (OC). This means that entries in the OC usually have an impact on entries in the CC.

Impacts are modelled as jolux:LegalResourceImpact.

:::{admonition} jolux:LegalResourceImpact
:class: note
:name: LegalResourceImpact
The owl:Class **jolux:LegalResourceImpact** is used to build an entry in the Classified Compilation out of different entries in the Official Compilation. Entries in the Official Compilation have impacts on entries in in the Classified Compilation. The jolux:LegalResourceImpact has two main predicates. jolux:impactFromLegalResource points to the source of the impact and jolux:impactToLegalResource points to the impacted resource.

As it is shown in the figure above, the connection between jolux:LegalResourceImpact and the entries in the OC and CC is not direct but through [jolux:LegalResourceSubdivision](#LegalResourceSubdivision). The predicates used to connect the source and the target of the impact are jolux:impactFromLegalResource and jolux:impactToLegalResource.

:::{admonition} jolux:impactFromLegalResource
:class: note
:name: impactFromLegalResource
The object predicate **jolux:impactFromLegalResource** is used to connect a jolux:LegalResourceImpact to a [jolux:LegalResourceSubdivision](#LegalResourceSubdivision) as a source of the impact.

:::{admonition} jolux:impactToLegalResource
:class: note
:name: impactToLegalResource
