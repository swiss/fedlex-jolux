# Impacts

Impacts is what connect entries in the Classified Compilation and Official Compilation. The entries in the Classified Compilation are consolidations of entries in the **Official Compilation**. This means that entries in the Official Compilation usually have an impact on entries in the Classified Compilation.

Impacts are modelled as jolux:LegalResourceImpact.

:::{admonition} jolux:LegalResourceImpact
:class: note
:name: LegalResourceImpact
The owl:Class **jolux:LegalResourceImpact** is used to build an entry in the Classified Compilation out of different entries in the Official Compilation.
