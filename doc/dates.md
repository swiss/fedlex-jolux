:class: note
:name: dateDocument
The property jolux:dateDocument is used to indicate the decision date of an act, or the date on which the document was adopted. For bills, where there is no formal adoption date, the Document Date is used as the reference date.

:::{admonition} jolux:publicationDate
:class: note

:class: hint
During introduction of a new law, there are two similar but different dates relevant: the date of the **entry into force** and the date of the **applicability** of the law.

During this period of time there could be some transitional provisions in place.
